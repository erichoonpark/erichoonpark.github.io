<h2>Which two websites are you most inspired by?</h2>
	<p>The two sites, I was most inspired by were: 
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://alwayscreative.net/">Always Creative Design Studio</a></li>
		<li><a href="http://www.thisisnowexhibition.com/">This is Now Exhibition</a></li>
	</ul>
	</p>
<h2>How do they exhibit effective use of space, size, or balance?</h2>
	<h3>Always Creative Design Studio</h3>
	<p>
		The Always Creative Design Studio page renders with a clear focal point in the center of the page, and a simple background. By centering their brand and location, the studio provides a clear message at initial view of the website. Scrolling through the rest of the site, Creative Design utilizes clear lines and a combination of square/rectangle focal points. 
	</p>
	<h3>This is Now</h3>
	<p>
		This Is Now Exhibition opens with a full page layout. Each topic/theme takes up an entire page, and as the user scrolls, their flow stays the same. Due to a variety of fonts and focal points, the design suggests a lacks coherence or organization, and instead a free flow of ideas.
	</p>
<h2>What makes them similar and different?</h2>
	<p>
		Both designs represent a modular design with geometric focal points throughout the page. Although the Now Exhibition is a full page frame, the Always Creative Design Studio focuses on smaller frames. In my opinion, I believe the Creative Design Studio does a better job in curating both its content and its user.
